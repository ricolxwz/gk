## ACID

- Atomicity: A transaction is either performed entirely or not performed at all
- Consistency: 
    - All database constraints are satisfied
    - The new database state satisfies the specification of the transaction
- Isolation: Effect of multiple transaction running concurrently, the effect of the execution is such that it is as if they are running sequentially
- Durability: Once the transactions are committed, they must be persist even if there is a system failure

### Isolation

#### Interface Issues
- Lost update: A: 100, B: 200, the value is overwitten by B
- Temporary update: A: 100 -> 50, B is unaware of this change, still read 100
